# timeSeriesFeatures

Compares the feature sets of the extractors _catch22_, _Kats_, _tsfeatures_, _TSFEL_ and _tsfresh_, with respect to their computation time, internal structure and relationships between the different sets.
Furthermore, it evaluates how selected classification and regression models are affected by these features, identifying which features have the most significant impact on the model.





## Prerequisites

- seaborn
- numpy
- pandas
- feather
- sklearn
- sktime
- shap
- pycatch22
- kats
- tsfeatures
- tsfel
- tsfresh


## setComparison

The analysis introduced in https://github.com/hendersontrent/feature-set-comp was used as a guideline.
